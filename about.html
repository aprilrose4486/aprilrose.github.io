<h1 style="text-align: center;">About This Page</h1>
</div>
<br>
<p style="color: white;">This page is dedicated to the work that I have done as a web specialist/developer/coder. 
I have also created this page to show my capabilities and the skills that I have learned, 
towards becoming a well-rounded web developer. Yes, the design and coding was all done by yours truly!</p>
<p>And if you don't care anything about that and just interested in my art and photograpy...well...there's a section for that too.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; color: white;">About Me</h2>
<br>
<center><img src="C:/Users/Veteran/Downloads/DevProject/resources/aboutmeimage.jpeg" alt="self image"></center>
<br>
<p> I started my career and my path down the road of coding as a graduate student at Wayne State University.
During that time, I studied as an Information Science Major with a concentration on Data Analytics, 
and as an Information Management secondary major with a concentration on Software Tools.<p/>
<p> While obtaining my dual masters, as required, I worked as a practicum. The company then hired me as their 
Web Specialist. This allowed me to have on the job experience of using the coding programs that I learned,
while also learning new programs, and learning how to maintain, manage and add to a functioning website. 
It has also been my responsibility to make sure that the website was up-to-date and meet with the QA and SEO standards, 
and train and assist staff with adding content onto our web domain.</p>
<br>
<h2 style="text-align: center; color: white;">My Backstory/Bio</h2>
<br>
<p>
Iâ€™ve been fascinated with technology since I took my first steps. I was always the one that stayed indoors, taking apart 
electronics so I could figure out just how they worked. If I wasn't taking things apart, I had my nose buried in our home computer,
playing around with every feature that I could find. I've learned used Microsoft Word to write poems since I was in elementary school, 
and only increased my knowledge of Microsoft Suites over time.</p>
<p>My love for the arts, in the form of the violin and fine arts, took me down the path of being able to attend 
The Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts. There I learned a vast variety of ways to create art outside of just drawing.
I learned digital media, how to create art through technology by the way of Photoshop and Adobe Creative Suite 
(Recieving my 1st Bacholers in fine Arts with a concentration on Photography).
College (at Wayne State University) only helped to enhance my creative abilities and technical knowledge, recieving my 2nd bacholers degree
in Linguistics and a minor in Spanish and in Public Relations.</p>
<p>The military may not have contributed to my knowledge of computer science, but it has taught me patience, 
flexibility and the ability to adapt to any situation. It also taught me how to stay focused and be determined with everything that I do 
and set my mind to. Because being 1% of the 1% that become and make it through Marine Corp training isn't easy, and if a person
can make it through that, there's nothing that they aren't capable of doing or achieving.</p>
The place where I learned the most about computer science was through friends, YouTube, Codecademy, work and from obtaining my last 2 degrees. 
I love to learn and learning from my friends that are trained ethical hackers has been an eye-opening and wonderful experience. 
These are all things that I believe served me well in the School and during the start of my career.
